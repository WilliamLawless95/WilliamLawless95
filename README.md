**Hanging Cable Problem**

This Python script solves the 'Hanging Cable Problem' featured as an Amazon interview question. The script prompts the user to enter the length of a hanging cable, the height of each of the two towers between which the cable hangs, and the height of the cable at its lowest point.

The output will be the distance between the two towers.

This script works for both general cases: 
  1. The two towers are of equal height. In this case, we utilize the Hyperbolic Identity to solve the problem.
  2. The two towers are of unequal heights. In this case, we utilize the Quadratic Formula to solve the problem.

In the Amazon interview question, the hanging cable is 80 m long, strung up between two towers 50 m high. The first case gives the height of the cable as 20 m above the ground at its lowest point. In this case, the towers are 45.405 m apart. The second case repeats the question except for the cable hanging 10 m above the ground at its lowest point. In this case, there is no solution as the towers occupy exactly the same point in space. Here the cable is neatly folded in two halves.
